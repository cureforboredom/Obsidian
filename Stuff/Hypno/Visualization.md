Hey kitten. I've prepared an exercise in visualization for you. I'm going to take you through the visualization step by step, and all you need to do is follow my voice. There's no pressure to get it right, and it's okay if your mind creates something a little different than what you think I wanted. 

Before we start, lay down comfortably and close your eyes. Let's take a moment to calm your mind and body. Take a slow breath in, feeling your lungs expand. Feel the pressure build in your chest, a similar pressure to the one clouding your mind. Now breath out. As you exhale, feel both the pressure in your chest, and the pressure in your mind melting away. Let go of any expectations, anxieties, and stress. Feel how light your chest has become, and let that feeling spread to your mind. 

Breath in 2 3, And out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. Only your breathing and my voice exist in this moment. Let your body completely fade from your awareness. Your current existence is no different than floating in a serene, empty void, with only my voice to guide you.

Breath in 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. Good. You are ready for the exercise. Remember, my voice will guide your mind through each step, and your only job is to follow. Let's begin.
### The Lemon
Think of a big wooden cutting board. It's nice and sturdy, sitting on a table in front of you. The wood feels smooth, only slightly worn. There is no wobble, and it does not slide. 

Sitting on the cutting board is a lemon. It is large and fresh, with a vibrant yellow color. You notice the shape, mostly round, but not quite a sphere. Reach out and pick up the lemon, feeling it's weight in your hand. You catch it's scent for a moment, fresh and acidic, but faint. Place the lemon back on the center of the cutting board.

On your right, you see a large chef's knife. It has a long blade, and a black, wooden handle. As you pick up the knife, you feel your palm wrap securely around the handle, and see the light reflect off the blade.

Take the knife and slice the lemon in half. Hear the spritz of juice as the knife bites into the fruit, feel the blade cutting easily through the lemon and stopping against the cutting board. Setting the knife down, you see it's blade coated in juice.

In front of you, the two halves of the lemon are resting on the cutting board, their cut sides facing up, the strong scent of lemon flooding the space. You reach out, taking one of those halves into you hand, and lift it to your open mouth. 

As you squeeze the lemon, juice pours into your mouth, fresh and sour and acidic, yet so refreshing. The taste and scent are intense, just as vibrant as the yellow lemon you're holding. You realize your lips have puckered from the sourness, and your mouth is watering.

Take a moment to just exist with the lemon, letting your mind process the smell, taste, color, and feeling. Breath for me kitten. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5.

You may exit this moment whenever you are ready. When you do, any sensations you experienced, and any visualizations you created, will be etched into your mind, able to be recalled with ease.
