I feel like I'm floating
face down and I can't breath
the water's cold against my rage
But still I'm not drowning
I want it to end
death sounds like a friend
whispering of cold release
the fear and pain could end.
Yet still I float, submerged in hate
Directed at myself and fate
I try to take a breath
to let the water in
to fill my lungs, snuff out my life
no last call, turn out the lights.

Fuck!
I can't. I can't. I can't... breath.

I can't give in to my old friend, death will have to wait.
The waves of disgust crash over me, smothering me with their weight.
I lift my head and see the shore
I can fight a little more
I start to swim
I start to sink
Fuck!
I can't. I can't.

I... can... Just... breath...
