Out 2 3 4 5

Thank you for joining me for this session. Begin by removing your clothes, and clearing any blankets, pillows, and other objects from your bed. Once you are finished, turn off any lights in your room. (pause for a moment). This session will require your complete focus. Proceed only if you won't be interrupted for the duration. (pause). Pause the recording if you need more time to prepare. (pause). Ready? Good. Lay down in the center of your bed. For now, rest your arms at your sides, and lay with your legs spread a little wider than shoulder width apart. Take a moment to ensure you are comfortable. Feel your bed support your body, and let yourself relax. Trust that you are safe, comfortable, and won't be interrupted. 

Gently roll your eyes up, up, up. Look as far up as you can. Now slowly close your eyes. Keep looking up, eyes closed, as we begin to focus on your breathing. Feel the air fill your lungs as you breath in, and feel yourself relax as you breath out.

Take a deep breath in now (pause for a count of three). Now exhale. (pause for a count of five.) Good, again. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5, In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. Each time you exhale, feel yourself focusing more and more on your breath. Feel your stress and tension fading out of focus. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. Good.

For the duration of this session, any time you aren't instructed to do otherwise, you will continue this breath pattern. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. Good.

As you continue to focus on your breathing, you will notice all other sensations start to fade. Your limbs begin by feeling relaxed and heavy, slowly fading from your awareness. You feel no need to move, other than to breath. You will only move when you are told.

In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. Good. Begin to shift your awareness away from your breathing slowly, losing yourself in the sound of my voice. I want you to make a simple choice now. Choose to give up control. Choose to focus only on my voice, to submit without question to my will. You are mine, and you will follow my voice deeper and deeper. You will remember everything we do today vividly. Each sensation, each command will be imprinted in your mind. This feeling of complete focus and submission will come easier in the future. It already feels natural. You are following my voice deeper into your own submission. You are losing yourself completely as you focus on my voice. You feel nothing but submission. Breath for me kitten. In 2 3. Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3. Out 2 3 4 5. Good. Feel yourself disconnecting from your past and future. All that exists is my voice, and all you want is to submit. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5. In 2 3, Out 2 3 4 5.
