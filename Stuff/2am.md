Nothing good ever ever happens after 2am
That's what they say right?
My bad, let me just flip the switch
Turn off the anxiety along with the lights

Watch the shadows spill out of me
The darkness inside come out to play
The angel on my shoulder went to sleep early
only demons surround the bed where I lay

ghosts of the past, present, and future
showing me visions of all my mistakes
regret soaks the air with the sound of despair
and the clatter of bottles of pills I could take

I didn't choose to stay up past 2am
insomnia is a hell of a drug
I'm tired and wired and desperate for sleep
nothing good is here in this pit that I've dug

Just self pity and pain
two hands, blood stained
a ball of bandages where there should be a heart
a tattered mess slowly falling apart

hey it's me
ptsd
let's play a game!
you remember something awful
and I'll make you relive it
as long as it takes
till your mind breaks
shattered like your self esteem
