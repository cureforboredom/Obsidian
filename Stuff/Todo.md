I imagine a card. I say I'll send it to her telepathically through our connection.

Have her turn the deck face up.

she spreads the cards, and we stare at them, forming a connection.

she points the camera away from the deck and picks a card, placing it face down away from the rest.

she squares up the deck, and places it on top of her card. I memorize the previous bottom card, which is now a key card.

she cuts the deck, then deals through the cards.

I pretend to miss her card, then have her go back and reveal she picked the card I imagined. Demonstrated by me showing her the card I have in my pocket.
