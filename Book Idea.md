MC Ryan, a poor kid raised by his dad's friend, dead parents. No inheritance.
Magic system heart dice roll for important actions and affect ambient luck.
Level up to gain dice slots and skill slots.
First dice are assigned at 12 by the church.
Ryan gets only one six sided die, black as the void and covered in ones. It absorbs all other dice he accepts, though he doesn't learn that immediately.
World has a dungeon. Dice are dropped by dungeon bosses.
Magic spells, physical skills, etc all roll dice. Most require at least two dice. 
Skills and spells are learned from skillbooks, which are dropped in the dungeon.
Most people form dungeon parties to delve, but ryan is looked upon as cursed. The church won't help him anymore, and he fails at nearly everything he tries.
The man raising him dies, and ryan is claimed as a servant to cover his debts. 
He's used as bait in the dungeon, but after his party dies he hides from the dungeon boss. Two days later another party kills it, and he sneaks after them into the second level, where there should be an exit. But his bad luck causes him to fall into a hidden tunnel, where he ends up on the 19th floor. After the 10th floor, there's only exits every five floors. 
He eats moss and drinks cave water to survive, slowly learning how to avoid the dungeon monsters. 
He finds a secret chest. Chest contents are decided by the challenges you've overcome in the dungeon compared to your level and total dice+skills.
He thinks if he can kill one dungeon monster, maybe he can get something good enough to survive from the chest.
